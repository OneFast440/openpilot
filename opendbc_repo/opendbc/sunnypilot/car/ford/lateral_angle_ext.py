Ford path-angle-primary lateral control ("angle control"), ported from BluePilot bp-7.0.

The PSCM evaluates y(x) = c0 + c1*x + 1/2*c2*x^2 + 1/6*c3*x^3 at a lookahead of only ~1.4 m at
highway speed, so c0 (path_offset) and c1 (path_angle) dominate and c2 (curvature) contributes at
the centimeter scale. Worse, c2 is fed through a speed-indexed low-pass filter inside the PSCM
(~35 ms at 100 km/h rising to ~330 ms at 5 km/h), so the module keeps acting on a curvature
command for up to a second after openpilot drops it. That lag, not model noise, is what produced
the ping-pong on Fords.

Angle control holds c0/c2/c3 at their inactive sentinels and steers with c1 alone:

    path_angle = kappa * v_ego * gain

where kappa is the planner's desired curvature (optionally blended with the model's predicted
curvature) and gain is a per-platform calibration times the user's tuning factors. The PSCM
executes the commanded angle directly, with no filter state to unwind.
